#### By **ANUM ASIF**
## Description
This application is developd to help the Maths Students to calculate the type of a triangle. In general, there are 3 types of a triangle i.e ISOSCELES, SCALENE and EQILATERAL. You can also use it to check whether the 3 lengths you have in mind will even make a triangle or not. Because this is the first thing it checks when you enter the required 3 values. Please note that it is developed only for numerical date. {This is a detailed description of your application, including its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }

## Technologies Used
- [JS-Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) - Advantage of using Functions: we can reuse the code as many times as we want by just defining it once and calling it in time of need.
We can also use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
- [JS-Arrays](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/quick_start) -Advantage of using arrays: we can store multiple values in a single variable.
